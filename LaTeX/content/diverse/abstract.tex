The programming language R is a very popular and powerful tool for statisticians, but by itself not designed for big data exceeding the local machines memory and processing capabilities. When analyzing large amounts of data, this quickly becomes a serious and unacceptable restriction.
This paper gives an outline about the large-scale data management system Apache Hadoop, it's underlying data storage and processing concepts and how it can be utilized from within R to overcome this restriction. To demonstrate the usefulness of Hadoop, a real world example from the field of stock trading is discussed in detail.
